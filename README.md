# The Last Library

> In a world consumed by dangerous creatures, destruction and death, a wise mage wandered around the lands savaging all the books, papers, parchments and every written knowledge he found.
> Sealed away in a safe land, protect by an acient spell casted uppon the entrace, lies The Last Library. The compendium of what's left of human knowledge.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to provide a nice structure to create, access and modify Deeds and it's effects. In the future I also want to add creatures to the library so you can manage your catalog of beasts and NPCs inside the same workspace, being easy to add existing deeds to a creature, for example.
